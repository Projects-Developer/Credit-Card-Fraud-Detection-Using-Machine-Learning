## abstract: 
This project presents a machine learning-based approach for detecting credit card fraud. Utilizing historical transaction data, we employ supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to identify patterns and anomalies indicative of fraudulent activity. Our predictive model aims to accurately detect suspicious transactions, reducing financial losses and enhancing the security of credit card transactions.
